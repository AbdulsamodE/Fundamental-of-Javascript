# Fundamentals of JavaScript â€“ Practice Project

This repository contains my personal notes, code snippets, and practice challenges while learning **JavaScript** through a Udemy course.

It includes everything from basic syntax to arrays, objects, loops, functions, and coding challenges.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Covered

Here are some of the topics I practiced in this project:

- âœ… Strict mode
- âœ… Variables and data types
- âœ… Functions: declarations, expressions, arrow functions
- âœ… Function calling other functions
- âœ… Arrays and their methods (push, pop, shift, unshift, includes, etc.)
- âœ… Objects and methods (`this`, dot vs bracket notation)
- âœ… Loops: for, while, nested loops, loop control (`break`, `continue`)
- âœ… Basic DOM manipulation (later)
- âœ… Coding challenges for better understanding

## ðŸš€ Goal of the Project

This project serves as a **learning playground** while following a JavaScript course. The goal is to:

- Practice writing clean, understandable code
- Learn JavaScript fundamentals in a hands-on way
- Prepare for real-world frontend development
